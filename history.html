<p class="plots">Alien (1979)</p>
<p class="plot1description">Behind the Scenes:</p>
<p class="history">The making of Alien was particularly interesting. The film only had a
budget of 11 million dollars, and most of the special effects done were the work of pure artists
and not computers. The Alien, was played by a 6'10 Nigerian man named Bolaij Badejo. Most of the most
iconic effects throughout the movie were made and executed live, including the infamous chestburster scene.</p>

<p class="plot1description">Fun Facts:</p>

  <li>Alien wasn't easy to sell, until Star Wars came along and popularized the sci-fi industry</li>

  <li>The character 'Ash' wasn't even in the original script, he was created by the producers.</li>

</ul>

<p class="plots">Aliens (1986)</p>
<p class="plot1description">Behind the Scenes:</p>
<p class="history">Aliens had a much bigger budget this time around and they did great things with it.
Since they were lead by James Cameron's directing, there was much more action and plot involved in
the script. Many actors practiced their stunt and fight scenes as often as they could including Weaver,
who practiced with firearms and shooting to keep up with her role.</p>

<p class="placeholder">s</p>

<p class="plot1description">Fun Facts:</p>
<ul class="a">
  <li>The sounds that the Aliens make throughout the movie are actually created from baboons.</li>
  <li>Many people were required to create the Queen Xenomorph character. Up to 16 operators would work on her during filming.</li>
  <li>There were only five alien costumes used during filming, even though there are scenes with dozens of aliens on screen.</li>
  <li>The infamous knife scene wasn't actually in the original script, and nobody told Bill Paxton it was going to happen.</li>
  <li>The young girl who played Newt would purposefully hold up filming because she was having fun sliding down the vents.</li>
  <li>Bill Paxtion improvised many of his lines, including the famous "Game over, man!"</li>
  <li>Carrie Henn hated having to say her most famous line, "They mostly come at night. Mostly."</li>
  <li>20th Century Fox loved Cameron's script so much that they were willing to wait until he was done directing Terminator to come back and finish.</li>
  <li>The set for Aliens was later reused for Tim Burton's first Batman movie.</li>
</ul>

<p class="plots">Alien 3 (1992)</p>
<p class="plot1description">Behind the Scenes:</p>
<p class="history">Alien 3 was a real struggle to produce compared to its previous films. The production
schedule was extremely rushed, and multiple different people came and went to work on the script and make
revisions. They went through multiple plot lines until they settled on a more somber script. This film solely
focused on plot rather than action with half of it being about the internal struggle of the prisoners on Fury 161.</p>

<p class="placeholder">s</p>

<p class="plot1description">Fun Facts:</p>
<ul class="a">
  <li>The film was considered to be a total flop in North America, and rightfully so.</li>
  <li>Michael Biehn was extremely annoyed that his character was killed off so early, to the point that he refused to let the studio use a dummy of a corpse in his likeness.</li>
  <li>Sigourney Weaver had to wear a wig between takes because her 2 year-old daughter didn't like seeing her mother bald.</li>
  <li>The original budget had quickly ballooned up to 65 million dollars (originally 45 million) after several of the cast had quit.</li>
  <li>Alan Dean Foster refused to write any more Alien adaptations after the studio rejected his initial novelisation of Alien 3.</li>
  <li>David Giler openly admits that he personally regrets writing the movie.</li>
  <li>David Fincher (the director) still refuses to speak about the movie to this day.</li>
</ul>

<p class="plots">Alien Resurrection (1997)</p>
<p class="plot1description">Behind the Scenes:</p>
<p class="history">There isn't much to tell about Alien Resurrection's filming process. It wasn't as much of a
disaster to produce than Alien 3, but somehow it ended up being an even worse movie. It never should have been made
and the series should have stopped at 2, or had a completely rewritten script for 3 using Alan Dean Foster's
novelisations.</p>

<p class="placeholder">s</p>

<p class="plot1description">Fun Facts:</p>
<ul class="a">
  <li>Winona Ryder signed up for the role without even reading the script for the bragging rights.</li>
  <li>Sigourney Weaver was not too keen to work on another Alien movie, as she had enjoyed the fatal ending of the previous film and thought it was a good end to her character.</li>
  <li>Weaver's fee for the movie was equal to the entire budget of the first film, 11 million dollars.</li>
  <li>The original script called for Newt to be requrrected, not Ripley.</li>
  <li>Joss Whedon was unhappy that the director decided to play his script straight rather than the intended tongue-in-cheek.</li>
  <li>Ron Perlman almost drowned shooting the underwater sequence. The cast would train for weeks to be able to hold their breath underwater long enough.</li>
  <li>The basketball shot made by Weaver was completely legit. It took an insane amount of takes, but eventually they got it right.</li>
