<p class="about">     Alien is series of movies beginning in 1979. There are four films that follow eachother:
   Alien(1979), Aliens(1986), Alien 3(1992), and Alien Resurrection(1997). Though most fans and critics say that the last
 two films in the series are the worst, they add to the lore that is within the Alien community.</p>

 <p class="plot1description">Alien (1979), starts off with the crew of the USCSS Nostromo, an M-Class star freighter
   set on course to Earth while towing a mineral ore refinery. The crew (Dallas, Kane, Ripley, Ash, Lambert,
   Parker, and Brett) awaken to find out that their ships interface MU/TH/ER, has intercepted a distress signal
   from an unknown source on an uninhabited moon. Dallas, Kane and Lambert go to check the distress beacon
   and Kane ends up with an alien organism attached to his face. The team go back to the ship (in complete
   disregard to Ripley and the science quarantine law) and end up infecting the ship with a stray Xenomorph.
   It begins wreaking havoc and killing off the crew members one by one until Ripley initiates the self
   destruct sequence on the ship and escapes on the emergency escape shuttle, the Narcissus.</p>

   <p class="plot1description">Aliens (1986) takes place 57 years after the original movie. Ripley is
     rescued by a salvage team after slipping through the network while in hypersleep. She was taken to
     the Gateway Station (a medical facility) and met Carter Burke, an employee representing
     Weyland-Yutani. Since being discovered, the executives of Weyland-Yutani's legal team don't believe
     her story of the Xenomorph and strip her of her license. Some time later, she is informed that
     the military has lost contact with the terraforming colony on LV-426. They discover that there has in fact
     been a Xenomorph outbreak and many of the colonists are dead. Ripley finds a young girl named Newt
     and looks after her for the rest of the movie. The soldiers find the main hive of Xenomorphs, but
     are ambushed and many of them die. Newt is later kidnapped by a Xenomorph. While waiting for
     their transportation, Ripley decides to go to the Xenomorph nest and rescue Newt, setting it on fire in the
     process. As they are about to board the ship, Ripley realized that the queen Xenomorph had followed them and leads
     it to the airlock, killing it.</p>

     <p class="plot1description">Alien 3 (1992), follows Ripley yet again on her quest with the Xenomorph.
       This movie starts out with a reveal that the shuttle (the USS Sulaco) that Ripley, Newt, Bishop
       and Hicks escaped to had crash landed on Fiorina "Fury" 161. Viewers learn that a fire had caused the
       Sulaco to land, killing everyone on board except Ripley. A facehugger survived on the Sulaco and
       then attacked one of the prisoners salvaging the ship. This leads to the Xenomorph growing and
       running around the prison picking people off one by one. Ripley has a queen implanted in her from
       the queen at the end of Aliens while she was in hypersleep. She eventually aids in the death of the
       Xenomorph by having a prisoner lead it to the metal pouring area, and pouring molton lead on it and
       eventually killing it. Soon after, a Weyland-Yutani executive attempts to convince Ripley to let him
       have the Xenomorph queen growing inside of her. Ripley decides to commit suicide by jumping into the pit
       of molton lead with the queen inside of her to officially kill it.</p>

       <p class="plot1description">Alien Resurrection (1997) happens 200 years after Alien 3. Scientists have
         worked for years trying to clone Ripley's DNA in an attempt to obtain Xenomorph DNA. Eventually they
         are successful on the eighth attempt, creating Ripley 8. She is a mix between human and Xenomorph thus
         giving her a massive amount of strength. Eventually, the Xenomorph specimens have escaped and are picking
         off all of the scientists on the ship. Ripley 8 and a few other survivors leave and attempt to escape the
         ship. While leaving, Ripley 8 discovers that the scientists had used her Xenomorph DNA to clone a Xenomorph,
         however when it lays its spawn instead of an egg, its clear that the Xenomorph queen also has human DNA. One
         of the other survivors lures the Queen's baby away from Ripley 8 so she can escape with the rest of the crew.
         Later everyone meets up at the airlock inside of the escape betty where the humainoid Xenomorph just happens to be at. 
         After getting near it, she sees the airlock window and throws her acid blood onto it, causing it
         to suck the humanoid Xenomorph out the window, crushing it and sucking all of its blood and crushed bones out.</p>
